Pascal’s Wager is often cited as a rational justification for religious belief: if God exists, faith secures infinite reward; if He does not, the cost of belief is negligible. The mathematics, Pascal thought, is decisive.

The argument turns on a familiar decision-theoretic formula:

\\[
\text{Expected Value} = \text{Probability of Event} \times \text{Payoff}
\\]

Even if the probability that God exists is vanishingly small, multiplying any positive probability by infinite reward yields infinite expected value. Faith, therefore, is rational.

This reasoning, as James Cargile argued [[1](#cargile)], fails at its core. If Pascal’s use of probability were correct, probability theory itself would be incoherent.

### **The Key Assumption**

The wager requires that “God exists” be assigned some non-zero probability. But on what basis? Pascal relies, implicitly, on the *Principle of Indifference*: the claim that any proposition that is logically possible and not known to be false should receive a positive probability.

This assumption is untenable. Logical possibility alone does not justify assigning positive probability, because there can be infinitely many mutually incompatible possibilities.

Cargile illustrates this with the example:

> “There exists a God who prefers contemplating the real number $x$.”

For each real number $x$, this defines a distinct, mutually incompatible hypothesis. Each is logically possible; none is ruled out. Pascal’s wager, if applied naively, would require assigning a probability $p > 0$ to each hypothesis. With uncountably many such possibilities, the sum of probabilities exceeds 1, a direct contradiction.

More generally, any framework generating infinitely many mutually incompatible belief systems — each logically possible — suffers the same problem. Attempting to assign a positive probability to each either leads to contradiction or renders the wager useless: no single hypothesis can be rationally singled out for belief.

Even simpler, mundane examples illustrate the issue. Consider:

> “There are $n$ rabbits in the universe.”

For every natural number $n$, the proposition is logically and epistemically possible. Assigning each a positive probability again yields an infinite sum. Any attempt to assign decreasing fractions, e.g., $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \ldots$, is arbitrary and unmotivated.

The lesson is clear: logical possibility does not entail probabilistic plausibility.

### **Why the Wager Fails**

Pascal’s argument depends on assigning non-zero probability to “God exists” (or any candidate belief system). But with infinitely many mutually incompatible possibilities, no consistent assignment is possible. Assigning the same positive probability to each leads to a sum exceeding 1, a direct contradiction. Allowing the probabilities to vary across hypotheses avoids this numerical impossibility, but then the wager loses all force: it can no longer indicate which belief system is rational to adopt. The expected-value calculation is rendered ineffective, and rational belief collapses to assessing which beliefs are best supported by evidence rather than abstract calculation.

Cargile’s insight is decisive: the problem is not the plausibility of any particular deity, but the internal coherence of Pascal’s probability reasoning. The wager does not provide a mathematical justification for faith; it exposes the limits of applying expected-value reasoning to infinitely many mutually exclusive possibilities.
